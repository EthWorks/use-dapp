# Replaced Transactions

UseDapp supports replaced transactions.
After replacing transaction on wallet, you will see it as a prevoius transaction(one you replaced) and it will be treated as a previous transaction.

Here is code snippet from source code:
```tsx
const isDroppedAndReplaced = (e: any) =>
  e?.code === errors.TRANSACTION_REPLACED && e?.replacement && (e?.reason === 'repriced' || e?.cancelled === false)

const droppedAndReplaced = isDroppedAndReplaced(e)

if (droppedAndReplaced) {
const status: TransactionState = e.receipt.status === 0 ? 'Fail' : 'Success'
const type = status === 'Fail' ? 'transactionFailed' : 'transactionSucceed'

addNotification({
    notification: {
    type,
    submittedAt: Date.now(),
    transaction: e.replacement,
    receipt: e.receipt,
    transactionName: e.replacement?.transactionName,
    originalTransaction: transaction,
    },
    chainId,
})
```
