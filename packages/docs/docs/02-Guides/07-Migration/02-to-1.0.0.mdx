# Migrating to 1.0.*

## No longer support for web3-react

`web3-react` connectors are removed from useEthers hook and `useDapp` does not support them.

If you want to integrate wallet with useDapp you should use specific wallet provider like [here](/docs/Guides/Connecting/Wallet%20Connect).

## Multichain support

UseDapp supports multichain queries, tutorial is available [here](/docs/Guides/Connecting/Multi%20Chain).

## Custom provider support

Now you can inject custom provider and not always pass rpc link.

**Example**

```tsx
const config: Config = {
    readOnlyChainId: Mainnet.chainId,
    readOnlyUrls: {
      [Mainnet.chainId]: getDefaultProvider('mainnet'),
    },
}
```

## Small fixes

A lot of small things are upgraded, it has a lot of impact on DApp performance and loading speed.
