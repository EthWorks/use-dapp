# Connecting to custom Chains

In this tutorial, we will go through the steps of connecting to a custom Chain, that's not listed as part of [known Chains](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp/tree/master/packages/core/src/model/chain).

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes the user has already started with the basics of `useDApp`.

See the [Getting Started](../getting-started) guide if you are a new user.

## Motivation

The typical use of `useDApp` is to connect to a well known chain, such as Ethereum Mainnet or xDai chain.

However if your use case is to connect to a lesser known chain, or a custom one created by your team, this tutorial uncovers the steps required to connect `useDApp` to any chain.

As a first step, see if your chain is not already listed in the list of [known Chains](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp/tree/master/packages/core/src/model/chain).

## Step 1 - Create the new chain object

The first step is to create a Chain configuration object with all the required information regarding the custom chain.

### Example

```javascript
import { Chain } from '@usedapp/core'

export const TutorialChain: Chain = {
  chainId: 99999,
  chainName: 'TutorialChain',
  isTestChain: false,
  isLocalChain: false,
  multicallAddress: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  getExplorerAddressLink: (address: string) => `https://tutorialchain.etherscan.io/address/${address}`,
  getExplorerTransactionLink: (transactionHash: string) => `https://tutorialchain.etherscan.io/tx/${transactionHash}`,
}
```

## Step 2 - Include your chain in Config

## Step 3 (optional) - Send a PR to `useDApp`
