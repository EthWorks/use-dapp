# Custom Hooks

There is a number of useful hooks that you can use to read blockchain state:

- ``useBlockMeta()`` - return meta information (``timestamp`` and ``difficulty``) about most recent block mined
- ``useEtherBalance(address)`` - returns ether balance as BigNumber for given address (or ``undefined``)
- ``useTokenBalance(tokenAddress, address)`` - returns balance of a given token as BigNumber for given address (or undefined)
- ``useTokenAllowance(tokenAddress, ownerAddress, spenderAddress)`` - returns allowance of a given token as BigNumber for given owner and spender address pair (or undefined)

Sooner or later you will want to make a custom call to a smart contract. Use ``useCall`` and ``useCalls`` for that purpose.
See section below on creating custom hooks.

## Creating custom hook

Creating a custom hook with the use of our core hooks is straightforward, for example letâ€™s examine the *useTokenBalance* hook.

The hook will retrieve a balance of an ERC20 token of the provided address.

```tsx
  function useTokenBalance(
    tokenAddress: string | Falsy,
    address: string | Falsy
  ) {
    const { value, error } =
      useCall(
        address &&
          tokenAddress && {
            contract: new Contract(tokenAddress, ERC20Interface), // instance of called contract
            method: "balanceOf", // Method to be called
            args: [address], // Method arguments - address to be checked for balance
          }
      ) ?? {};
    if(error) {
      console.error(error.message)
      return undefined
    }
    return value?.[0]
  }
```

Another example is useTokenAllowance hook. Instead of balanceOf, we use allowance on ERC20 interface.

```tsx
  function useTokenAllowance(
    tokenAddress: string | Falsy,
    ownerAddress: string | Falsy,
    spenderAddress: string | Falsy
  ) {
    const { value, error } =
      useCall(
        ownerAddress &&
          spenderAddress &&
          tokenAddress && {
            contract: new Contract(tokenAddress, ERC20Interface),
            method: 'allowance',
            args: [ownerAddress, spenderAddress],
          }
      ) ?? {}
    if(error) {
      console.error(error.message)
      return undefined
    }
    return value?.[0]
  }
```

The *useCall* hook will take care of updating the balance of new blocks.
The results are deferred so that the hook does not update too frequently.

In our custom hooks we can use any standard react hooks, custom react hooks and useDapp hooks.
Rules of hooks apply.

Documentation for hooks is available [here](../core#hooks).

## Using hooks considerations

There are some important considerations when using hooks based on `useRawCall`, `useRawCalls`, `useCall` and `useCalls`.

Avoid using the result of one hook in another.
This will break single multicall into multiple multicalls.
It will reduce performance, generate delays, and flickering for the user.
Instead, try to retrieve needed information in a single call or multiple parallel calls.
That might require modification of smart contracts.
If that is too complex consider using a custom backend or [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/).
